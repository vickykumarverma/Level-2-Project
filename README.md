Here are 3 mini-projects I’m excited to share:

❌⭕ 1. Tic-Tac-Toe Game (2 Player)
A classic game with full win/draw detection, turn tracking, and replay option. Built using 2D arrays and logical conditions.

🎯 2. Password Strength Checker
Checks for password length, digits, upper/lowercase letters, and special characters — gives feedback based on complexity.

🗂️ 3. File Encryption/Decryption Tool
Encrypts or decrypts text files using a Caesar cipher: Users input file paths and choose the mode (Encrypt/Decrypt)
Processes text content and writes to a new file
